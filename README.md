# tld_platformerEngine
A barebones platformer engine.

Ladies and Gentlemen, after years of trying to learn game development and programming in general, I finally figured out how to program jumping and gravity from scratch! I don't why, I just couldn't figure out how to program jumping for the longest time. I had to rely on preprogramed systems in game engines, but now I've finally done it. Words can't describe how much of an achievement this is. I also learned more about collision detection and return statements while making this, so that's nice.

Anyway, this work just how you expect a platformer engine to work. Press the left and right keys to move, and press space to jump. You won't be able to clip into any walls or walk out of the screen. If you fall into any pits, you'll respawn back at you starting position. If you touch the bottom of the tile while jumping, your jump will be cut short you'll start falling. I even made it so you'll hover for a very small amount of time at the end of a jump before you start falling again. Also, the level will be generated based of the json file. You can edit it if you want to.

You're free to use this as a reference or base for you own projects, I don't really mind, I just wanted to know if there's anything I could do better.
